# Automate Vanilla! – Minecraft Modpack

Automate Vanilla! is a modpack that keeps Minecraft feeling like Minecraft but adds some quality-of-life improvements and automation. It’s all about making things a bit smarter and smoother without breaking the game.  

With mods like **Create**, **JEI**, and **Farmer's Delight**, you can:

- Automate farms and other resources  
- Make crafting and workflows easier  
- Explore the world more efficiently  
- Follow a simple questline if you want a little guidance  

Basically, if you like vanilla but want some extra tools and clever tweaks, this is for you.

## How to Install

> Tip: Give Minecraft at least 4GB of RAM if you can.

## Where the Pack Is Headed

This version, 1.2.4, is the final Gen 1 release. I cleaned out the unneeded export files and gave you the stable base for playing.  

Looking ahead to Automate Vanilla 2.0, I want to:

- Make the files cleaner and more organized  
- Keep the development process clear so you can see what’s being worked on  
- Have a public bug list on GitHub  
- Polish things so the pack just feels smoother and better overall  

Big thanks to everyone who has downloaded and played so far—we recently hit 250+ downloads. That really means a lot.
